# UNMAINTAINED

I'm archiving this repo as I have completed my CKS studies.
I used this repo exclusively to create my lab environments
for testing and learning, but I have since passed the CKS.
Use this repo as-is or for inspiration, but changes in
tooling may cause something to not work as expected.

Start with the README in `terragrunt/`, then the README in `ansible/`.

No warranty.  Use at your own risk.
